# Introduction to Algorithms

This repository contains some of the algorithms described in the [Introduction to Algorithms, fourth edition](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-fourth-Thomas-Cormen-ebook-dp-B09XJBVNQR/dp/B09XJBVNQR/)

I will try to include some of them in multiple programming languages but I will mostly focus on Clojure and Golang
